Q1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A1. When we initialize a new repository then a .git file is made that stores meta-data.
	We need to initialize a repository in order to start tracking the files using git.

Q2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A2. Working directory is the directory on which we are currently working on and repository is a snapshot of the working
	directory at different points in time. Staging area is in intermediate stage which Git provides where files have to be
	added before they can be commited. If one adds a file which he did not intended to commit he can reset that, this provides
	more flexibility.
